Clevernote - a command line interface to Evernote

Author: dvj (Doug Johnston)

Evernote is a cross platform note taking system. They have GUI clients for Windows and Mac, various mobile platforms, and a web client. I still prefer doing most of my quick work from the command line, so here's an implementation of a command line client.

The client currently uses markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to handle notes with rich text. Obviously pictures and media dont come across too well though :P
