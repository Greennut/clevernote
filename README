Clevernote - a command line interface to Evernote

Author: dvj (Doug Johnston)

Evernote is a cross platform note taking system. They have GUI clients for Windows and Mac, various mobile platforms, and a web client. I still prefer doing most of my quick work from the command line, so here's an implementation of a command line client.

Requirements:
You need to have the Evernote API code and Thrift code in your PYTHONPATH, which you can get from http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/

You'll also need to sign up for an Evernote API key which you can get from the same page. After signing up for an account you'll get a Consumer_key and a consumer_secret from Evernote (I think they use a manual process, so be a bit patient). You'll need to put these into the top of the clevernote.py file for things to work.

Next you'll need to make an Evernote account on their dev server, at http://sandbox.evernote.com/

Finally (!), you're ready to use the script. Enter your account info when prompted, and you should have access to your notes from the command line. Yey!

Hopefully, after this gets a little more mature it can go through some process to be able to access the regualr evernote service (not the dev service) and work for everyone.



About:
The client currently uses markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to handle notes with rich text. Obviously pictures and media dont come across too well though :P
